# Code Of Conduct

## Our standards
This project expects all participants to:
- be respectful and professional;
- focus feedback on behavior and code, not personal attributes;
- avoid harassment, hate speech, threats, or abusive language;
- collaborate in good faith and keep discussions technical and constructive.

## Scope
This applies in repository issues, pull requests, code reviews, and related community channels.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may edit, hide, lock, or remove content that violates this policy and may limit participation for repeated or severe violations.

## Reporting
For conduct concerns, open an issue titled `conduct: report` with minimal details and maintainers will follow up privately.
