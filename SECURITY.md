# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Security fixes are applied to the latest release line.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- If unavailable, open a minimal issue titled `security: private contact requested` and do not include exploit details.

## Response targets
- Initial acknowledgment: within 72 hours.
- Triage result: within 7 days.
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and release constraints.
